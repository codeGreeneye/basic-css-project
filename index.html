                Not to be confused with Vegetarianism, Plant-based diet, or Abolitionism (animal rights)</p>
            <p>
            Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products—particularly in diet—and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity
             status of animals.[c] A personwho follows the diet or philosophy is known as a vegan.
            Distinctions may be made between several categories of veganism. Dietary vegans, also known as "strict vegetarians", refrain from consuming meat,
             eggs, dairy products, and any other animal-derived substances.[d] An ethical vegan is someone who 
            not only excludes animal products from their diet but also tries to avoid using animals,[19] animal products,[e] and
             animal-tested products[22] when practical.[23] Another term is "environmental veganism", which refers to the avoidance of animal products
              on the grounds that the industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.[24] Another motivation for veganism is 
              concern about animal welfare.

            <h2>ORIGIN</h2>

            <h4>Vegetarian etymology</h4>

            <p>
                The term "vegetarian" has been in use since around 1839 to refer to what was previously called a vegetable regimen or diet.[32] Its origin is
                 an irregular compound of vegetable[33] and the suffix -arian (in the sense of "supporter, believer" as in humanitarian).[34] The earliest known 
                 written use is attributed to actress, writer and abolitionist Fanny Kemble, in her Journal of a Residence on a Georgian plantation in 1838–1839.[g

            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>
                Vegetarianism can be traced back to the Indus Valley civilization in 3300–1300 BCE in the Indian subcontinent,[37][38][39] particularly in northern and
                 western ancient India.[40] Early vegetarians included Indian philosophers such as Parshavnatha, Mahavira, Acharya Kundakunda, Umaswati, Samantabhadra,
                  and Valluvar; the Indian emperors Chandragupta Maurya and Ashoka; Greek philosophers such as Empedocles, Theophrastus, Plutarch, Plotinus, and Porphyry;
                   and the Roman poet Ovid and the playwright Seneca the Younger.[41][42] The Greek sage Pythagoras may have advocated an early form of strict vegetarianism,
                   [43][44] but his life is so obscure that it is disputed whether he ever advocated any form of vegetarianism.[45] He almost certainly prohibited his 
                   followers from eating beans[45] and wearing woolen garments.[45] Eudoxus of Cnidus, a student of Archytas and Plato, writes, "Pythagoras was distinguished 
                   by such purity and so avoided killing and killers that he not only abstained from animal foods, but even kept his distance from cooks and hunters".[45] One
                    of the earliest known vegans was the Arab poet al-Maʿarri, famous for his poem "I No Longer Steal From Nature". (c. 973 – c. 1057).[46][b] Their arguments
                     were based on health, the transmigration of souls, animal welfare, and the view—espoused by Porphyry in De Abstinentia ab Esu Animalium ("On Abstinence
                      from Animal Food", c. 268 – c. 270)—that if humans deserve justice, then so do animals

            <h2>Vegan diets, substitutions, and meat analogues</h2>

            <p>Vegan diets are based on grains and other seeds, legumes (particularly beans), fruits, vegetables, edible mushrooms, and nuts.[164]
                Soy milk
                Meat substitutes
                Vegan meat alternatives are commonly sold in forms like vegetarian sausage, mince, or veggie burgers.[165] They are often made from soybeans,
                 seitan (wheat gluten), beans, lentils, rice, mushrooms or vegetables.[166] Meat substitutes have been made in China since at least the Tang dynasty
                  (618 to 907 common era), including mock duck made from seitan. They are much newer to Western countries.[167] Some famous Western producers of vegan 
                  meat alternatives include Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat. But in the late 2010s many meat producers and supermarkets also started making their own 
                  brands of vegan meat substitutes.
                  Plant milks—such as soy milk, almond milk, cashew milk, grain milks (oat milk, flax milk and rice milk), hemp milk, and coconut milk—are used in place 
                  of cow or goat milk.[k] Soy milk provides around 7 g (1⁄4oz) of protein per cup (240 mL or 8 fl oz), compared with 8 g (2/7oz) of protein per cup of cow's
                   milk. Almond milk is lower in dietary energy, carbohydrates, and protein.[170] Soy milk should not be used as a replacement for breast milk for babies.
                    Babies who are not breastfed may be fed commercial infant formula, normally based on cow milk or soy. The latter is known as soy-based infant formula or
                     SBIF.[171][172]
                   Butter and margarine can be replaced with alternate vegan products.[173] Vegan cheeses are made from seeds, such as sesame and sunflower; nuts, such as cashew,[174] pine nut,
                     and almond;[175] and soybeans, coconut oil, nutritional yeast, tapioca,[176] and rice, among other ingredients; and can replicate the meltability of dairy cheese.[177] 
                   Nutritional yeast is a common substitute for the taste of cheese in vegan recipes.[173] Cheese substitutes can be made at home, including from nuts, such as cashews.[174]
                     Yoghurt and cream products can be replaced with plant-based products such as soy yoghurt.

            <div class="clothes">
             <h1>Clothing</h1>
        <p>
            Many clothing products may be made of animal products such as silk, wool (including lambswool, shearling, cashmere, angora, mohair, and a number of other
             fine wools), fur, feathers, pearls, animal-derived dyes, leather, snakeskin, or other kinds of skin or animal product. While dietary vegans might use animal
              products in clothing, toiletries, and similar, ethical veganism extends not only to matters of food but also to the wearing or use of animal products, and
               rejects the commodification of animals altogether.[20]: 62  Most leather clothing is made from cow skins. Unlike ethical vegans, dietary vegans do not
                oppose the use of leather and may continue to wear leather they bought before adopting the diet on the grounds that they are not financially supporting 
                the meat industry.[201] Ethical vegans may wear clothing items and accessories made of non-animal-derived materials such as hemp, linen, cotton, canvas,
                 polyester, artificial leather (pleather), rubber, and vinyl.[202]: 16  Leather alternatives can come from materials such as cork, piña (from pineapples),
                  cactus, and mushroom leather.[203][204][205] Some vegan clothes, in particular leather alternatives, are made of petroleum-based products, which has
                   triggered criticism because of the environmental damage involved in their production.
